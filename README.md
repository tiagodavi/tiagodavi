## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With 15 years of experience as a Software Engineer, including 5 years in Artificial Intelligence, I have helped create over 50 projects throughout my career, many of them from scratch. I've worked at over 15 different companies with various challenges, including top companies like Apple, as well as startups in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Norway. I have successfully adapted to teams of various sizes, ranging from small groups of 3 individuals to larger teams of 20. I am used to working under project constraints, and I consistently strive to upgrade my skills every day.
